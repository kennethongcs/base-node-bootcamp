# Vessel Forecasting


Needs/Goals:

To streamline the process of updating vessel loading forecasts between offices from different regions.

Frustrations/Pain points:

Setting up the database with all required information for the vessel forecasting app to work.

Problem Statement:

Vessels typically have routes that span multiple countries, and each country has their own method of reporting their total loadings on a vessel.
This project is done with the aim of having a common platform for all regions to use and to update their loadings, so other regions are able to see the loadings in real time and to react accordingly (to top-up or to trim their cargoes).
